# concreet-onderwijsproducten-site

I made the design and used Foundation 6 to build this site.
The site is fully responsive.
The code consists mainly of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of javascript.
A website builder used this code to implement the site in WordPress.
You can see the result here: http://www.concreetonderwijsproducten.nl
