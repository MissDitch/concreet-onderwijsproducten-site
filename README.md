# concreet-onderwijsproducten-site
I used the Foundation framework to make this site. The code consists mainly of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of javascript.
A website builder used this code to implement the site in WordPress. 
You can see the result here: http://www.concreetonderwijsproducten.nl
